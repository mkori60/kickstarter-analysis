# Kickstarting with Excel 
An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
Uncovering trends in kickstarter data in order to help Louise succeed with her own kickstarter campaign to fund her play called Theater.  

## Analysis and Challenges
I began by analyzing the mean, median, standard deviation, and boxplot values for the goal and pledged values of the successful and failed campaigns. <img width="466" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 1 04 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83051034/116920635-1ebba400-ac10-11eb-902a-d9e54f62fcdd.png">
I then analyzed the number of failed, live, successful and canceled campaigns for each campaign type. <img width="575" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 1 06 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83051034/116920900-74904c00-ac10-11eb-8966-2e627366f217.png">
Next, I completed the same analysis using subcategories. <img width="604" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 1 07 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83051034/116921008-9db0dc80-ac10-11eb-9d99-1a3ff76ecc97.png">

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
I then began focusing specifically on the theater category by analyzing the outcome based on launch date. <img width="408" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 1 12 17 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83051034/116921424-347d9900-ac11-11eb-986c-71a3ee6f0e20.png">

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
Lastly, I analyzed the outcomes of plays based on their goals. <img width="894" alt="Screen Shot 2021-05-03 at 1 14 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83051034/116921619-71499000-ac11-11eb-94b4-4aa778be7648.png">

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encounter any significant difficulties while conducting my analysis. However, at times the large file size significantly slowed my computer down and caused Excel to crash. 

## Results
- Based on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" data, I was able to conclude that Louise should begin her crowdfunding campaign at the beginning of Summer in May or June. I was also able to conclude that Louise should refrain from starting her campaign in October or December. 

- Based on the "Outcomes Based on Goals" data, I was able to conclude that the most successful campaigns for plays set their goals for between $0 and $4999, or for between $35000 and $44999. The highest rate of failure occurred for campaigns with a goal between $30000 and $34999, and for campaigns with a goal greater than $50000. 

- The main limitation for this data set is that the category of 'plays' is not broken down by further sub-categories so we are unable to know if particular genres of plays have had greater success. I could create another line chart that analyzes the country that kickstarter campaigns were conducted in in order to understand which countries have proved most successful. I could also create a graph to show whether extended deadlines have proved to be substantially beneficial to the succcess of a campaign.
